                    <strong>Operation Citadel</strong> (German: Unternehmen Zitadelle) was a German offensive 
                    operation in July 1943 against Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, proposed by 
                    Generalfeldmarschall Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Manstein during the Second World War 
                    on the Eastern Front that initiated the Battle of Kursk. The deliberate defensive 
                    operation that the Soviets implemented to repel the German offensive is referred 
                    to as the <strong>Kursk Strategic Defensive Operation</strong>. 
                    Following the defeat at Stalingrad
                    <em>(Where Nazi troops surrendered to Soviet troops)</em>
                    Hitler was faced with an overwhelming realisation that his
                    objective was going to be hard to obtain.

                <p>
                    The goal was to surround and capture the Russian city of <strong>Kursk</strong>. As the German High Command desperatley needed a win.
                    The reason being that the Allies had already started landing in Southern Italy and Hitler had to move troops to counter the
                    Italian Offensive. This lead to further worries that the Eastern Offensive would not be a feasible campaign.

                <p>
                    Arguebly the Brtitish had the most significant role. The British had been aiding the Soviet Leadership with intelligence (thanks to the cracking of the ENIGMA code).
                    With this the British had handed over the details regarding Operation Citadel to Stalin.

                <h2>The lead up</h2>
                <p>
                    After the conclusion of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.
                    <br>
                    Strategic discussions also occurred on the German side, with Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle (Operation Citadel).

                <p>
                    The object of the operation was to capture Kursk using the
                    famous <strong>Blitzkreig</strong> to attack a singular point <span><em>(from various sides)</em></span> towards the Soviet defences 
                    this however had not gone according to plan. Arguebly the battle that ensued would become the deadliest Tank battle as of now.
